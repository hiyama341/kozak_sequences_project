# Kozak sequences project

Kozak sequences are a type of consensus sequence that play a critical role in the initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes. Specifically, Kozak sequences are short nucleotide sequences located near the start codon of a gene, and they help to facilitate the recognition and binding of ribosomes to the mRNA transcript during translation initiation.

In this notebook, we provide an analysis of how to extract Kozak sequences using the example of Aspergillus oryzae. We discuss the general characteristics of Kozak sequences, including their consensus sequence and the factors that influence their strength and efficacy. We also provide a step-by-step guide on how to extract Kozak sequences from a genome using python tools and techniques.
